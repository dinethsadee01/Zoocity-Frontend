        <p class="vision">Keeping up with the modern concept of a zoo which is more of an educational and conservation-based visitor centre, which provides an opportunity to see the animals close to its natural state, the Zoocity Zoo was designed with a unique taste of architecture and complete with immerse exhibits.</p>
